# Deep-Music
In this project, I use LSTM RNN architecture to generate music. The entire Bach corpus from MuseData website (http://musedata.org/) has been used which has 417 raw midi files of the works of the prolific composer Johann Sebastian Bach. When converted to 50 length sequences for training the RNN, I was able to get 2441 sequences which is a good number for training the RNN.
